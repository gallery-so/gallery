## ðŸ¤” What's going on with Next.JS?

We're in the middle of a migration to Next.JS. So we're not fully leveraging all of the Next.JS features.
Temporarily, we are re-routing all requests to use `/` under the hood or `pages/index.tsx` which renders
our root `App` component. We're achieving this through this `next.config.js` section.

```js
{
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      // Rewrite everything to `pages/index`
      {
        source: '/:any*',
        destination: '/',
      },
    ];
  }
}
```
