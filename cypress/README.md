### Fixtures
A place to store all the static data to run a test. Example: username, collection name, user ID, etc.

### Integration
All the testing files will be stored. There are two folders inside it which are pages and specs. 

* **Pages** - It's where all the helper functions or DOM query in a specific page. 
* **Specs** - It's where the testing spec and instruction happen. It needs to be in `.spec.ts` format. 

### Plugins
Plugin dependency file if we want to extend the cypress functionality from a third party.

### Support
This is where you can create custom commands or overwrite existing cypress commands.
