           * !!! WARNING !!!
           *
           * This is quite possibly one of the worst crimes I've committed to date.
           *
           * THE LONG-TERM PLAN is to have a context that keeps track of the user's
           * scroll position at various pages, and we can toss this file and its window
           * location madness.
           *
           * Now for the explanation....
           *
           * We currently have a hack that overrides the browser's own attempt to
           * place the user at their intended scroll position to prevent jank that
           * coincides with our fade transition.
           *
           * Unfortunately, we end up shooting ourselves in the foot if the user
           * hasn't scrolled at all. If the user doesn't scroll and they navigate
           * to another page, the browser doesn't try to restore their scroll,
           * and we end up overriding the subsequent *active* scroll made by the
           * user themselves. More specifically:
           *   1) User scroll at 0
           *   2) User navigates to another page
           *   3) User arrives at 0
           *   4) User begins scrolling
           *   5) Our hack rejects their scroll, restores scroll back to 0
           *   6) User experiences jank and is thrown back to the top of the page
           *   7) User possibly experiences motion sickness
           *
           * THE FIX: disable our hack if the user is sufficiently close to
           * the top of the page.
           *
           * THE CAVEAT: we don't want to intervene if scrollY is exactly 0, because
           * that signals that the browser is actively pushing the user to the next page,
           * and we DO want to block that default behavior â€“ otherwise the jump occurs
           * before the transition begins. Thus the `window.scrollY > 0` condition.
